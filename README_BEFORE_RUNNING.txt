Due to Git having uncompressing issues when it comes to .fbx files that are larger then 1kb, 
If running the game does not work through gradescope downloaded files,
please instead download the game through the GitHub Desktop app as it uncompressed the files correctly on there.

The link to the github is here: https://github.com/Avery-13/War-of-Heroes/tree/Project-Prototype
The Project Prototype is the branch we used to submit on gradescope
