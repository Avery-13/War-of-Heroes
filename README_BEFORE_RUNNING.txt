Due to Git having uncompressing issues when it comes to .fbx files that are larger then 1kb, 
If running the game does not work through gradescope downloaded files,
please instead download the game through the GitHub Desktop app as it uncompressed the files correctly on there.
If you run into issues such as dependencies errors. In the "war-of-heroes" folder, please copy the "Terrain_and_Model" folder. 
Then in another window, navigate to "war-of-heroes" folder and replace the "Terrain_and_Model" folder with the same folder you just copied. This will reimport the dependencies correctly.
